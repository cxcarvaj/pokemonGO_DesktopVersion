## PokemonGo Desktop Version

Pokemon Go Desktop Version is a Java project that I did when I saw OOP in ESPOL and it was my first approach to videogame development, for which I am very fond of it, even if it is not perfect.
Here, have a look :)

## Installation and usage

Just download it or clone it and open the project in your favorite IDE for Java. To catch the Pokemon you have to click on them and it will be captured ðŸ˜¼. You can see all of your captured Pokemons at the right of your screen
